I'm a Web developer with over 10 years of experience working on projects using Ruby.
I enjoy sharing my technical knowledge, business insights, and the challenges I encounter in my work.

I created this blog to store my knowledge and share it with everyone.

I intend my blog to be written by English. Even though English is not my strong point.
And I'm still in the process of improving it every day.
Writing this blog is one of the ways for me to improve my English skill.

Therefore, if what I write is not grammatically correct or difficult to understand, please let me know. I welcome feedback from everyone.

Additional, everything I write here is based my limited knowledge, so it may not be entirely accurate. I am always open to correction and discussion in the spirit of mutual respect.

Thank you very much for visiting my blog.
